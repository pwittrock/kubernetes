      synopsis: Update the annotations on a resource
      description: |2

        Update the annotations on one or more resources.

        An annotation is a key/value pair that can hold larger (compared to a label), and possibly not human-readable, data.
        It is intended to store non-identifying auxiliary data, especially data manipulated by tools and system extensions.
        If --overwrite is true, then existing annotations can be overwritten, otherwise attempting to overwrite an annotation will result in an error.
        If --resource-version is specified, then updates will use this resource version, otherwise the existing resource-version will be used.

        Valid resource types include:
           * clusters (valid only for federation apiservers)
           * componentstatuses (aka 'cs')
           * configmaps (aka 'cm')
           * daemonsets (aka 'ds')
           * deployments (aka 'deploy')
           * events (aka 'ev')
           * endpoints (aka 'ep')
           * horizontalpodautoscalers (aka 'hpa')
           * ingress (aka 'ing')
           * jobs
           * limitranges (aka 'limits')
           * nodes (aka 'no')
           * namespaces (aka 'ns')
           * petsets (alpha feature, may be unstable)
           * pods (aka 'po')
           * persistentvolumes (aka 'pv')
           * persistentvolumeclaims (aka 'pvc')
           * quota
           * resourcequotas (aka 'quota')
           * replicasets (aka 'rs')
           * replicationcontrollers (aka 'rc')
           * secrets
           * serviceaccounts (aka 'sa')
           * services (aka 'svc')

      synopsis: Auto-scale a Deployment, ReplicaSet, or ReplicationController
      description: |2-

        Creates an autoscaler that automatically chooses and sets the number of pods that run in a kubernetes cluster.

        Looks up a Deployment, ReplicaSet, or ReplicationController by name and creates an autoscaler that uses the given resource as a reference.
        An autoscaler can automatically increase or decrease number of pods deployed within the system as needed.
      options:
      - name: cpu-percent
        default_value: "-1"
        usage: The target average CPU utilization (represented as a percent of requested
          CPU) over all the pods. If it's not specified or negative, a default autoscaling
          policy will be used.

      - name: min
        default_value: "-1"
        usage: The lower limit for the number of pods that can be set by the autoscaler.
          If it's not specified or negative, the server will apply a default value.
      - name: name
        usage: The name for the newly created object. If not specified, the name of
          the input resource will be used.

          exists.
      - name: recursive
        shorthand: R
        default_value: "false"

      description: |2

        Dumps cluster info out suitable for debugging and diagnosing cluster problems.  By default, dumps everything to
        stdout. You can optionally specify a directory with --output-directory.  If you specify a directory, kubernetes will
        build a set of files in that directory.  By default only dumps things in the 'kube-system' namespace, but you can
        switch to a different namespace with the --namespaces flag, or specify --all-namespaces to dump all namespaces.

        The command also dumps the logs of all of the pods in the cluster, these logs are dumped into different directories
        based on namespace and pod name.
      options:
      - name: all-namespaces

When a value is modified, it is modified in the file that defines the stanza.  When a value is created, it is created in the first file that exists.  If no files in the chain exist, then it creates the last file in the list.

      description: |2

        Create a configmap based on a file, directory, or specified literal value.

        A single configmap may package one or more key/value pairs.

        When creating a configmap based on a file, the key will default to the basename of the file, and the value will
        default to the file content.  If the basename is an invalid key, you may specify an alternate key.

        When creating a configmap based on a directory, each file whose basename is a valid key in the directory will be
        packaged into the configmap.  Any directory entries except regular files are ignored (e.g. subdirectories,
        symlinks, devices, pipes, etc).

      description: |2-

        Create a new secret for use with Docker registries.

        Dockercfg secrets are used to authenticate against Docker registries.

        When using the Docker command line to push images, you can authenticate to a given registry by running
          'docker login DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER --username=DOCKER_USER --password=DOCKER_PASSWORD --email=DOCKER_EMAIL'.
        That produces a ~/.dockercfg file that is used by subsequent 'docker push' and 'docker pull' commands to
        authenticate to the registry.

        When creating applications, you may have a Docker registry that requires authentication.  In order for the
        nodes to pull images on your behalf, they have to have the credentials.  You can provide this information
        by creating a dockercfg secret and attaching it to your service account.

      synopsis: Create a secret from a local file, directory or literal value
      description: |2

        Create a secret based on a file, directory, or specified literal value.

        A single secret may package one or more key/value pairs.

        When creating a secret based on a file, the key will default to the basename of the file, and the value will
        default to the file content.  If the basename is an invalid key, you may specify an alternate key.

        When creating a secret based on a directory, each file whose basename is a valid key in the directory will be
        packaged into the secret.  Any directory entries except regular files are ignored (e.g. subdirectories,
        symlinks, devices, pipes, etc).
      options:
      - name: dry-run

        Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector.

        JSON and YAML formats are accepted.

        Only one type of the arguments may be specified: filenames, resources and names, or resources and label selector

        Note that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if someone
        submits an update to a resource right when you submit a delete, their update
        will be lost along with the rest of the resource.

        Drain node in preparation for maintenance.

        The given node will be marked unschedulable to prevent new pods from arriving.
        The 'drain' deletes all pods except mirror pods (which cannot be deleted through
        the API server).  If there are DaemonSet-managed pods, drain will not proceed
        without --ignore-daemonsets, and regardless it will not delete any
        DaemonSet-managed pods, because those pods would be immediately replaced by the
        DaemonSet controller, which ignores unschedulable markings.  If there are any
        pods that are neither mirror pods nor managed by ReplicationController,
        ReplicaSet, DaemonSet or Job, then drain will not delete any pods unless you
        use --force.

        When you are ready to put the node back into service, use kubectl uncordon, which
        will make the node schedulable again.

        Edit a resource from the default editor.

        The edit command allows you to directly edit any API resource you can retrieve via the
        command line tools. It will open the editor defined by your KUBE_EDITOR, or EDITOR
        environment variables, or fall back to 'vi' for Linux or 'notepad' for Windows.
        You can edit multiple objects, although changes are applied one at a time. The command
        accepts filenames as well as command line arguments, although the files you point to must
        be previously saved versions of resources.

        The files to edit will be output in the default API version, or a version specified
        by --output-version. The default format is YAML - if you would like to edit in JSON
        pass -o json. The flag --windows-line-endings can be used to force Windows line endings,
        otherwise the default for your operating system will be used.

        In the event an error occurs while updating, a temporary file will be created on disk
        that contains your unapplied changes. The most common error when updating a resource
        is another editor changing the resource on the server. When this occurs, you will have
        to apply your changes to the newer version of the resource, or update your temporary
        saved copy to include the latest resource version.

        This command will hide resources that have completed. For instance, pods that are in the Succeeded or Failed phases.
        You can see the full results for any resource by providing the '--show-all' flag.

        By specifying the output as 'template' and providing a Go template as the value
        of the --template flag, you can filter the attributes of the fetched resource(s).

        Perform a rolling update of the given ReplicationController.

        Replaces the specified replication controller with a new replication controller by updating one pod at a time to use the
        new PodTemplate. The new-controller.json must specify the same namespace as the
        existing replication controller and overwrite at least one (common) label in its replicaSelector.

      synopsis: Set a new size for a Deployment, ReplicaSet, Replication Controller,
        or Job
      description: |2-

        Set a new size for a Deployment, ReplicaSet, Replication Controller, or Job.

        Scale also allows users to specify one or more preconditions for the scale action.
        If --current-replicas or --resource-version is specified, it is validated before the
        scale is attempted, and it is guaranteed that the precondition holds true when the
        scale is sent to the server.
      options:
      - name: current-replicas
        default_value: "-1"
        usage: Precondition for current size. Requires that the current size of the
          resource match this value in order to scale.
      - name: filename
        shorthand: f

        usage: Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to
          false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If
          not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already
          exists.
      - name: recursive
        shorthand: R
        default_value: "false"
        usage: Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when

      - name: replicas
        default_value: "-1"
        usage: The new desired number of replicas. Required.
      - name: resource-version
        usage: Precondition for resource version. Requires that the current resource
          version match this value in order to scale.
      - name: timeout
        default_value: 0s
        usage: The length of time to wait before giving up on a scale operation, zero
          means don't wait. Any other values should contain a corresponding time unit
          (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h).

        Display Resource (CPU/Memory/Storage) usage of pods.

        The 'top pod' command allows you to see the resource consumption of pods.

        Due to the metrics pipeline delay, they may be unavailable for a few minutes
        since pod creation.
